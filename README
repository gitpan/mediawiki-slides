Takes a list of articles for a presentation as well as the
presentation name and generates a navigation box for
these slides, which also hightlights the current slide.

This package is intended to integrate into Wikimedia, the software
behind popular wikis like http://en.wikipedia.org/.

Example input:

	<slides>
	name=My Presentation
	Start
	How to?
	Finish
	</slides>

would result in something like this:

	[[My Presentation - Start|Start]] - [[My Presentation - How to?|How to?]] - [[My Presentation - Finish|Finish]]

=head1 Check the Signature

First you need to check the signature on the package to verify that
it is untampered and intact. To do this you have to:

=over 2

=item *

Install the Perl module Module::Signature from http://search.cpan.org

=item *

Get my key from http://bloodgate.com/tels.asc, import it into
GnuPG with:

	gpg --import tels.asc

You may also let the C<cpansign> utility fetch it automatically
from a keyserver, if that works for you.

=item *

Extract the package to a directory, change there and then:

=item *

Type on a console:

	cpansign --verify

inside the unpacked directory. 

=back

If the last step says "good signature" or "SIGNATURE VERIFIED OK",
everything is all right.

Note that if you C<cpansign> let GnuPG download my key from a keyserver,
it might put a C<tels.asc> file in the package directory, and then afterward
complain that "tels.asc" is not in the MANIFEST:

 Not in MANIFEST: tels.asc
 ==> MISMATCHED content between MANIFEST and distribution files! <==

You can safely ignore this warning.

B<NOTE:> Please notify me immidiately if the signature
does not verify. In that case do B<NOT> install this software, your system
might get compromised!

=head1 Installation

This extension was developed and tested with Mediawiki 1.6.3. It seems to
work on 1.5.x, too, but you are encouraged to update the Mediawiki software.

=head2 Run the testsuite

Run in the directory of this package:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make test

All tests should pass. If not, please notify me.

Make a backup of your wiki directory! I repeat, MAKE A BACKUP! You have been
warned!

Now copy B<all> the files from the C<extensions/> subdirectory inside
this extension to the extension dir of your wiki, like so:

	http_docroot
		\ - cgi-bin			etc
		\ - wiki
			\ - extensions		<-- to here

At present this is only one file, C<Slides.php>.

Then include the following line at the bottom of your C<LocalSettings.php>,
but before the "?>" line:

	require_once('extensions/Slides.php');

=head1 Usage

A complete presentation, created with this very module itself, can
be found at:
